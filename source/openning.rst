Opening
=======

Initially everyone assembled in the main hall, and everyone was eager for the day's events to start.
The opening session was chaired by massyuu who explained the days events and the layout of the venue.
There were also initial welcoming remarks by the Pycon Kyushu chairman, Yukio Kusakabe, before the keynote speaker, Ai Makabe, took to the stage.

Ask the speaker
===============

There were two rooms reserved for ask-the-speaker events, where at multiple times during the day there was the option to discuss directly with the speakers and ask them for further details of their presentations.
For example, 志村 朋人's talk about Pythonによる人工知能入門 sparked intense interest from a number of people who took full advantage of the opportunity to learn more about 志村さん's AI-related presentation.

Lunch and sponsor LT
====================

Everyone had the opportunity to discuss the morning's events over lunch which consisted of a very tasty lunch box.
This was in addition to the free drinks provided by the sponsor LINE at their café.
Later during lunch there were lighting talks from the sponsors.
In addition to the interesting traditional style sponsor talks from companies such as LINE (kindly allowing use of their premises for the event), there were also a number of more unusual talks from companies such as Xoxzo on the pleasures of working remotely (including wifi at the beach) and Snapdish on the history of spoons.

Job board
=========

Several companies also opted to make use of the job board to advertise opportunities.

Group photo and closing ceremony
================================

At the end of the day's events there was a summary of the day and a group photo.
It was challenging to fit everyone in the photo, but it gave a good sense of the roughly 200 people present and the large hall that accommodated everyone.
Finally there were closing remarks by the Kycon Kyushu chairman, Yukio Kusakabe, and it was revealed that Pycon Kyushu would be held again the following year, next time in Okinawa, news of which was greeted favourably by the audience.
